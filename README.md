This project explores stock price prediction utilizing a machine learning approach, specifically employing the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model. Leveraging regression techniques and model evaluation through AIC (Akaike Information Criterion), the project aims to enhance forecasting accuracy. The hypotheses testing assesses the significance of model parameters in predicting stock prices. By integrating statistical methodologies and machine learning, this study contributes to the advancement of robust and reliable stock price prediction models, offering valuable insights for investors and financial analysts.

Here we will predict the target variable based on two models Linear regression is a statistical model is used to show that a dependent variable and one or more independent variables have a linear relationship.It is predicated on the idea that the variables have a linear connection, which implies that changes to the independent variable or variables cause constant changes to the dependent variable and Time series model(ARIMA) AutoRegressive Integreated MovingAverage using this model in order to identify patterns and temporal connections in the data, the moving average (MA) and autoregressive (AR) com- ponents are combined in the ARIMA time series forecasting model. It is intended exclusively for use with time series data, in which subsequent observations depend on earlier ones.
